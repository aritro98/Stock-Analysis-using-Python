This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock prices using technical indicators such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and other metrics. The project utilizes the `pandas-ta` library for technical analysis and `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data for 10 companies over a 5-year period. The final dataset is prepared and stored in a CSV file for further analysis and visualization.
